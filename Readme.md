# Librarian Core

This is supposed to contain the Librarian class, which provides a few simple interfaces to file stuff.
Librarian lets you save and load text files to a certain directory.
These might include DMPs, trajectories, volumes of interest, etc.

## Running it

```
rosrun librarian_core core.py
```

`$LIBRARIAN_ROOT` defaults to `~/.costar/`.
