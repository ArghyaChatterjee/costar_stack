# CoSTAR 

***Collaborative System for Task Automation and Recognition***

These are the tools and utilities we created to get the CoSTAR project up and off the ground.

## Packages

  * Bringup: launch tools
  * Librarian: file management
  * Predicator: robot knowledge management
  * Gripper: utilities for integrating different grippers into UI
  * Tools: packages used for different aspects of the UI

## Bringup

## Gripper

  * ***Simple S Model Server***: This is a part of our CoSTAR UI -- cross platform robot graphical user interface for teaching complex behaviors to industrial robots. This wraps a couple simple 3-finger gripper commands, which we can then expose as UI behaviors.=
