# SP Segmenter

The file "main_ros.cpp" is what you run if you want to use this as a ROS node.

## Prerequisites

We need:
  - Sequence of object partial views in the correct lighting conditions
  - Mesh of the object (for ObjRecRANSAC)
  
## Training Model



## Executing

How to run the code (with the default SVM):

```
rosrun sp_segmenter sp_segmenter_node -p
rosrun sp_segmenter republisher.py
```

You need to run this from the root of the directory right now.
