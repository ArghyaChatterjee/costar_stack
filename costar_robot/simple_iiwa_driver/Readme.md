# Costar Robot Manager

This code is the CoSTAR robot manager. It provides simple services for instantiating high-level actions on different robots. It's a work in progress, but has all the features needed for the Hannover Messe demos.

## TODO

  - UR5 support using the URX package.
  - Test joint space waypoints and movement.
  - Add other motion primitives and trajectory learning.
