# CoSTAR Bringup

This describes tools and systems for reproducing our implementation of the CoSTAR system on a KUKA LBR iiwa 14. The particular combination of the LBR iiwa and the Robotiq 3-finger gripper gives us a powerful range of capabilities.

## Hand-Eye Calibration

We provide a model-based approach for hand-eye calibration.

We used the Robotiq kit for adapting a 3-finger gripper to a touch IO flange.
